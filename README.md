**NOTE**: There is now a rewrite in Go called [hooktftp](https://github.com/epeli/hooktftp)


# puavo-tftp

puavo-tftp is a dynamic read-only [TFTP][] server. It's dynamic in a sense it
can be configured to execute script hooks for a set of matched files on read
requests (RRQ) instead of reading files from the file system. The standard
output of the script will be used as the file content for those read requests.

## Configuration

Configuration file is read from `/etc/puavo-tftp.yml` by default. You can
customize it with `--config` switch. The file is in [YAML][] format.

Possible keys:

  - `root`: Serve file files from this root. Default: `/var/lib/tftpboot/`
  - `user`: If started as root drop to this user.
  - `group`: If started as root drop to this grop.
  - `verbose`: Set to true to enable debug logging.
  - `port`: Listen on port. Default: 69
  - `hooks`: See the next paragraph

All keys are optional.

### Dynamic files with hooks

The `hooks` option is a list of associative arrays with `regexp` and `command`
keys. The given regular expression will be matched against incoming read
requests (RRQ). On match the command will be executed with the requested file
as the first argument and the client ip address as the second instead of reading 
the file from the file system. The standard output of the command will be sent
as the contents of the requested file.

Matching is stopped on the first matched regexp. If no matches are found the
file is read from the file system like in normal tftp servers.

#### Example

Boot each LTSP client with custom kernel version using a web service.

Match mac address based pxelinux.cfg read requests in `/etc/puavo-tftp.yml`:

```yaml
hooks:
  - regexp: pxelinux.cfg\/01-(([0-9A-Fa-f]{2}[:-]){5}[0-9A-Fa-f]{2})
    command: fetch-boot-config
```

`fetch-boot-config` is script like this in the PATH:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# First argument constains the requested file path matching the regexp.
# For example 'pxelinux.cfg/bc-5f-f4-56-59-71'.
# Cut the mac adress from it
MAC=$(echo $1 | cut -d / -f 2)

# Fetch custom kernel version for the mac address from a http service
KERNEL_VERSION=$(wget -q -O - http://devices.example.com/kernel/$MAC)

# Generate boot config to stdout
echo "DEFAULT ltsp
LABEL ltsp
KERNEL ltsp/i386/$KERNEL_VERSION
APPEND ro initrd=ltsp/i386/initrd.img quiet splash"
```

Checkout the [hooks][] directory for real world examples.

## CLI switches

CLI switches can be used to override options in `puavo-tftp.yml`.

    Usage: [sudo] puavo-tftpd [options]
        -r, --root PATH                  Serve files from directory.
        -u, --user USER                  Drop to user.
        -g, --group GROUP                Drop to group. Default nogroup
        -c, --config FILE                Configuration file. Default /etc/puavo-tftp.yml
            --verbose                    Print more debugging stuff.
        -p, --port PORT                  Listen on port.
